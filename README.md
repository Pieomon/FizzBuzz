# FizzBuzz
Contains two coding files:
1)  An example from a private project, the registration page blade.  Uses web programming tools, under the laravel framework.
2)  A simple example of the FizzBuzz problem: Output to the screen the numbers 1 to 100, except that multiples of 3 prints Fizz, multiples of 5 prints Buzz (Both prints FizzBuzz).  This was created by Christopher Cobb as a quick coding example.  Programming Language Used: C++.
